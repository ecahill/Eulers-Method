My program, EulersMethod, requires MATLAB R2012a. It should be opened in Matlab and saved 
as a EulersMethod.m file. 

Use:
To begin using the program, start in the Command Window. Before running the function, 
choose your F(x,y). To enter this, type "F = @(x,y)[f(x,y);g(x,y)]", entering your 
f(x,y) and g(x,y) functions respectively. To enter your initial x value, type 
"x0 =" and then type your initial value of x. To enter your initial y value, type 
"y0 =" and then type your initial value of y. Next, to run the program, enter the function and 
its parameters in the following manner: "[x,y] = EulersMethod(h, x0, y0, T, F)" subbing in your
h and T values for those specific parameters, while leaving x0, y0, and F as the variable names.
The output will be the final x and y coordinates and a graph of the three approximations.

Troubleshooting:
If an error comes up while entering the F(x,y) in the command window, double check that all 
parentheses and brackets are closed. Also, ensure that proper Matlab syntax is being used.
(E.g. x*y as opposed to xy).
